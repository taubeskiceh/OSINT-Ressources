# 🔎 OSINT Tools (Open Source Intelligence) Ressources

OSINT is about collecting and analyzing information from publicly available sources. These tools help investigate IPs, domains, emails, or even assess your own digital footprint.


## 🦠 Malware Analysis

FileScan.IO – Automated file scanning, integrated with VirusTotal.

any.run – Interactive sandbox environment (free account offers short sessions).


## 🌐 Domain / IP Information

ipinfo.io – Whois data, geolocation, VPN/Tor detection.

DNSViz – DNS & DNSSEC analysis with visualization.

AbuseIPDB – Database of reported malicious/spam IPs.

IBM X-Force Exchange – Risk scoring for domains and IPs.

 
##  📧 E-Mail Analysis

MXToolBox – Mail server checks (SPF, DMARC, blacklists).


## 🔍 Vulnerability Search Engines

Shodan – Search engine for Internet-connected devices and systems.

Censys – Similar to Shodan, plus filtering by known exploits.


## 💻 Local OSINT Tools (often included in Kali Linux)

SpiderFoot – Automates data gathering from 200+ sources.

Maltego – Graph-based link analysis tool.

theHarvester – Collects emails, subdomains, and metadata for pentests.

Maryam – Modular OSINT & data collection framework.

OWASP Amass – Network mapping and attack surface discovery.


## ⚠️ Vulnerability Databases

CVE Details – Searchable database of known vulnerabilities with exploit info.

Vulmon – Vulnerability trends and analysis with visualizations.


## 👉 In short:

Assessment Tools → First look at website/server security & privacy.

OSINT Tools → Collect and analyze open-source data (malware checks, IP/domain info, network scans).
